I was on the spot when the protest began in Shanghai in Nov.27 2022.(Sunday)

The protest broke out in the evening on saturday. I ran there by metro at 7 am. But it was all empty with only police cars on the site. 

Ironically a city marathon was held just one block away, which mistook me that I felt the place was in martial law.

I went there again in the evening. Crowded people were everywhere with about 60% of them were photoing, the rest of the people were standing in silence or just showing white paper to the police (I think they are temporarily hired securities)

I left as my mobile phone is running out of power.

Twits shows that at 8pm the securities started to pull the students to the police car and stop the people to leave from the metro line 1&7 at changshu road. which is only about 200 meters away from the spot.
